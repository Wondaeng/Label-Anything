# Label-Anything

Label-Anything is a proof of concept project developed for the '2023 IGC Research Showcase'. This project demonstrates an image labeling tool that leverages Meta's SAM (Segment Anything Model) and Gradio framework. The aim is to streamline the image labeling process by using an auto-segmentation model, thereby eliminating the need for laborious polygon labeling.
